                <h1>"F*** Konami"</h1>
                <p>
                    You hear it all the time from not only BEMANI fans but from fans of other konami IP's as well.
                    It makes sense why everyone says it. Konami is a terrible company that just loves screwing over the people
                    who care about their products the most.
                </p>
                <h1>You Say You Hate Konami But You're Always At Round1 Playing DDR</h1>
                <h3>Note: This article is primarily talking about the DMV area, if you're outside of it then feel free to ignore me</h3>
                <h3>NOTE2: This is not talking about anyone specific this is just a general thing I notice</h3>
                <p>
                    I always find it so funny that the main ones that talk about how konami is a company that hates their american audience so much
                    are the same people to be in Round 1 playing the latest update they just graced us american peasants with. If you truly hate konami 
                    then why go to places that have to pay them to play their games? Wouldn't it make more sense to go to one of the many data arcades in 
                    the DMV area? <br>
                    I'm not just yapping here. ever since I learned about the things that konami does to screw over the people paying them I just <i>stopped playing at R1's</i>
                    Simple as that. If you live around any Data Arcades then why would you willingly go to Round 1 just to pay the people who don't want your patronage?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And dont hit me with the "w-w-w-well the new content..." it will not kill you to wait until it becomes available on eagle or something.
                    Is it really worth sending the message to konami that its okay for them to just keep on screwing us over at any chance as long as they keep releasing content?
                    As long as people just keep on giving konami money regardless of how konami treats their global audience they're going to keep on doing it without a care in the world.
