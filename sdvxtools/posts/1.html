                <h1>WELCOME TO BIGGS SDVX TOOLS</h1>
                <p>Hello everyone this is my website, BIGGS SDVX TOOLS.
                    As the name suggests I put tools for sound voltex on here. As of the time im writing this article, 
                    its just the random song picker but hopefully in the future I'll expand a bit.
                </p>
                <h1>ABOUT ME!!!</h1>
                <p>To be honest, I'm not very good at sound voltex.
                    I'm 17VF on keyboard and my most proud achievement is a lachryma 20 clear
                    on actual cabs I'm much worse trust me. <br>
                    My favorite character is Grace, I think shes neat. My second favorite would have to be SUPERSTAR MITSURU. God hes so cool. <br>
                    Oh and if you havent figured it out yet sound voltex isnt my main game
                    Its actually Pump it up. I make tools for that aswell, which I'll probably put on this website too.<br>
                    outside of rhythm games I play a whole bunch of gacha games (F2P BTW) of course I program a bit too.
                    I'm trying to get hooked up with an internship but this industry is cooked. I'm hoping that my like 1-4 hours a day will 
                    pay off in the grand scheme of things. <strong>ANYWAYS</strong> I also love speedcore, I've been a fan since 2020. My favorite artist is lmil
                    but I've been listening to a whole bunch of Xystran lately. He should release a solo album fr. 
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L898lRelV9RzATV7pYi0WyKEN_9SavjQ3Br7va2c2M0/edit?usp=sharing">I also have a google doc where I rate speedcore albums if you're interested</a>
                    I'm also a keyboard enthusiast but my wallet doesnt like that so I hardly ever make keyboards. Oh I almost forgot I'm an avid manga reader
                    9/10 thats what I'm doing right now
                </p>
