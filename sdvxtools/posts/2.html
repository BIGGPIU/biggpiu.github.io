                <h1>Arcade Rhythm Games Changed My Life</h1>
                <p>I probably sound like a madman when I say that something as simple as a genre of arcade games is
                    enough to make irreversible waves in my personal life. I probably am one for admitting that. But its true. Arcade Rhythm Games 100% changed my life
                </p>

                <h1>Let's Set The Scene</h1>
                <p>
                    When the Pandemic hit I had a whole lot of extra time on my hands to experience new hobbies. One of the hobbies that I got into was watching anime.
                    Though when I had started watching anime because of uhhh... past activities. I barely had any interest in anime that would've been considered "Mainstream"
                    at the time. Rather than watching One Piece, Dragonball, Attack On Titan or any other "Mainstream" anime I had found myself attached to
                    more slice of life. (if you're curious: my first anime was Death note. I never finished it and rather dropped it for Re:Zero)
                    Throughout the time of me watching anime like Blend S, Konosuba, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, and my soon to be favorite: Jashin Chan Dropkick. I had never told <strong>ANYONE</strong>
                    About my hobby. Not even my parents (when I went to my first anime convention my mom said she didn't even know I liked anime). All of it was due to shame.
                    Though when I look back at it, None of the things I watched were <i>Really that bad</i> but I still felt a large amount of shame regardless. <br>
                    I had considered the hobby that would take up hundreds of hours of my time to be embarrassing and something that must not get out no matter what.
                    Actually during this time, me and my friend had an argument online and he had threatened to say that I was a fan of Re:Zero in front of the whole class
                    virtually. Sounds harmless, right? I shouldn't have cared. It was True after all. But No. The thought of him uttering that one little statement about me to my peers had me extremely stressed for the entire weekend.
                    I had logged on to online school the following monday while being extremely stressed. Just for him to keep his mouth shut the entire time. It was so ridiculous that I was so
                    stressed for something that didn't even happen. It was even more ridiculous that I was so stressed just because someone wanted to share a harmless piece of information about me. Shame just had that kind of grip on me at the time.
                </p>
                <h1>OK, So Where Do Rhythm Games Tie Into This?</h1>
                <p>
                    That shame wasn't only for anime. It was also for things like listening to K-POP,J-POP and even my favorite music genre to this day: Speedcore.
                    At this point in time I would rather be caught dead than caught listening to Dreamcatcher,COOL&CREATE or Kobaryo. Well lucky for me This little dance game
                    at my nearby Dave & Busters included all of that! <br>
                    I had wanted to play Pump so badly when I was at Dave & Busters for my birthday, But there were so many things going through my mind.
                    <br><br> <i>"What if you look stupid"</i> the voice in the back of my head protests.
                    <br><br> <i>"What if you play an embarrassing song?"</i> My sense of shame exclaims.<br><br>
                    But just for that day, my desire to play a rhythm game that wasn't osu! or etterna overpowered the voices urging me to just walk away and go
                    play cruise n' blast or something. Little would I know that just deciding to insert a credit into pump and play would not only allow me to
                    meet so many wonderful people, but allow me to change as a person. <br>
                    When I had played, the worries from before quickly faded from my head. Rather than focusing on what I looked like from the outside. I had only thought about
                    the game. This changed how I viewed my hobbies altogether.
                    As I got into more and more Arcade Rhythm Games my ability to just ignore what other people may think of me gradually got better.
                </p>
                <h1>Arcade Rhythm Games Helped Me Accept That I'm Weird</h1>
                <p>
                    Rather than trying to fit in with what people around me define as the status quo for the first time in my life I had accepted that
                    <i>I'm Weird, I'm a Nerd, I'm not made to be popular with everyone</i> and that it was <strong>OK</strong>. I no longer felt restricted by anyone else
                    and the feeling was euphoric. As time went on I consistently became more open with <strong>all</strong> of my hobbies allowing me to do things like
                    joining my school anime club, running my school E-Sports club while proudly proclaiming to everyone that I do so, and going to my first anime convention. The past me
                    would have never done such things under the pretense that it would be <i>"Too Embarrassing"</i> but the me now does it without a shadow of doubt. I'm
                    marginally more satisfied with how I experience my hobbies now than I was in 2020-2022, And the main thing I can thank for that is a Korean Dance Game inside of
                    a Dave & Busters. Thank you, Andamiro. For developing a game that would inspire major change within myself. Thank you so much.

                    This is just one of thousands of stories of how these games have changed lives for the better. If you have your own story that you're willing to share
                    please feel free to DM atbigboichin on discord! I know how these games changed me but I'm curious on how it changed others as well.
