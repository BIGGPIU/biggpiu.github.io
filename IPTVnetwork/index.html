                <h1 id="Introduction">So You Want To Make Your Own IPTV Network</h1>
                <p>
                    I cant blame you its a good idea plus its ton of fun.
                    In the following guide I'll give you all the information
                    you need to know plus some tips to make your network as 
                    successful as possible 
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h1 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are a couple things you'll need to 
                        intall or have pre installed if you want to run your
                        own IPTV network. I'll go ahead and list everything you
                        need and where you can install or purchase the things you
                        need
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="computer">A Computer For Running Your Network</h2>
                    <p>
                        You might already have a computer laying around that 
                        you can run this on but if you dont thats okay. 
                        Ideally you would use a desktop computer for this but there
                        is nothing keeping you from using a laptop.

                        <br><br>

                        If you dont have a spare desktop computer or laptop laying
                        around thats fine. Luckily its really easy to find one
                        that can run your network for under 100$

                        <br><br>

                        You can typically find a computer for running your server
                        from places like

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Ebay - Ebay can be good and bad at the same time
                                on one side you can get scammed or can pay a bit too
                                much for an old office PC but on the other side you
                                can find a pc thats good enough for your IPTV network
                                for a good price. Just make sure you do your research
                                on the seller and what they're selling
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Thrift Stores - This is where I got my IPTV PC
                                from. Just check all the ones near you for a 
                                desktop pc. if you get lucky you might find one 
                                for a good price (for example I got mine for 25$)
                                The main thing you want to look out for when shopping
                                for an IPTV PC at a thrift store is buying a PC
                                that doesnt work. Before you buy your PC from a thrift
                                store make sure you plug it in for a second to make 
                                sure it cuts on. If you're really really anxious 
                                that you're going to get a computer that doesnt
                                work then you can plug it into a monitor if the 
                                thrift store has it

                                <br><br>

                                <div class="important">IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO NOTE</div>
                                <br> 
                                if you buy a computer from a thrift store sometimes there will
                                still be data on it. When you get this computer DO NOT look 
                                through that persons personal documents.
                                My computer had someones stuff on 
                                it when I got it. I personally looked for their email so I could
                                email them to see if they wanted any of their data back.
                                You dont have to do this if you dont want to. Nor do you
                                have to go through and delete all their stuff.
                                We're going to be wiping their data from their computer
                                regardless
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Pawn shops - They're pretty similar to thrift stores when it comes
                                to getting your PC. You just have to watch out for places that 
                                might try to overcharge you. Now this isn't every pawn shop
                                but some of the people that work at these places are non technical
                                and they might try to overcharge you for a bad PC just because
                                they think its a good "gaming PC" do your research on the specs
                                on whatever you're going to buy. Dont spend 200$ on an office PC
                                made before NVIDIAs 2000s series.  
                            </li>

                    <p>
                        Docker is a program that lets people create and ship "containers"
                        that contains the code for a program and everything else the 
                        program needs. We're going to use this to install the software
                        we need for our IPTV network
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>

                        You should create an account with docker or sign in if you already 
                        have an account if you need a guide on how to install docker desktop
                        then just google it. googling is an essential skill for this.

                        Jellyfin is the service we're going to use to distribute our tv network

                    <h2 id="duckdns" >Duckdns - Optional</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is technically optional but you really should

                        <br>
                        due to scammers typically using duckdns for malicious purposes

                <h1 id="pirate">How to get your media</h1>
                <p>
                    You cant have a tv network without content of course 
                    in this section I'll walk you through where and how to get it

                    <br><br>

                    <h2 id="boring">Legal options</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you're the type that doesnt break any laws including jaywalking
                        then you have the following options for getting content for your network

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Downloading from youtube - you can either find a website to do this
                                or you can do it through youtube itself if you pay for youtube premium.
                                the main drawback with this is your network may be kind of boring 
                                since you have no tv shows that people will actually keep up with.
                                
                                <br><br>
                                but heres the cool thing: even though your network might not be
                                appealing for others thats okay because 
                                <br><br>
                                <div class="important">ITS YOUR NETWORK!</div>

                                you can do whatever you want. nobody can tell you no. 
                                If you want to make a channel with every jacksepticeye video 
                                then go for it! nobody can stop you.
                             </li>

                    <h2 id="fun">"Legal" actions</h2>
                    <p>
                        this is the place where it gets fun. where you get your "legal" content
                        depends on what kind of "legal" content you want to download
                        <br><br>

                        <a href="https://fmhy.net" class="important">
                            generally you can find websites to download from at fmhy.net

                        <br><br>

                        For me personally on my network I mainly have anime running so I'll go over
                        what you can use for anime.
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                nyaa.si - This is a torrent only website that
                                nearly every "legal" anime website uses to download their stuff
                                you can choose to download things in any quality thats available.
                                remember when you torrent you should use a VPN so you dont get 
                                a letter in the mail from your ISP
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                You can also get content from some of your websites that you 
                                "legally" watch anime from online. The main drawback is that this 
                                is super inconvienient and you may not be able to find the quality you 
                                want
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Reddit - this is for general content but if you REALLY want find
                                something you can always check reddit. You might find someone else looking
                                for the same thing you want
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <p>
                    Depending on what your original operating system is and 
                    how powerful your computer is you might want to change your 
                    operating system. I've set up everything twice and I'll
                    list the pros and the cons for each programming sytem 
                    (that matters. MacOS doesnt matter.)

                    <br><br>

                    after reading over the pros get a flash drive and flash 
                    your choice of operating system onto your computer

                    <h2 id="Linux">Linux</h2>
                    Pros
                    <ul>
                        <li>Practically runs on a toaster</li>
                        <li>You get more control with your operating system</li>
                        <li>You can install other linux exclusive apps</li>
                    </ul>
                    Cons 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is more complex (kind of)</li>
                        <li>practically unusable if you dont have access to google</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 id="windows">Windows 11/10</h2>
                    Pros
                    <ul>
                        <li>more simple and user friendly</li>
                    </ul>
                    Cons
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uses more system resources by default meaning your TV network could run slower</li>
                        <li>There are tons of different versions of windows with different features missing on each one</li>
                    </ul>

                <h1 id="sErsatz">Setting up ErsatzTV</h1>
                <p>

                    once you have ersatzTV installed and running you can navigate to it by going to
                    <a href="127.0.0.1:8409">127.0.0.1:8409</a>
                    <br><br>

                    First you want to add the content you're going to 
                    have on your network into one folder. Theres a specific 
                    way you have to set up your folder or it will not work.

                    <br><br>

                    (note from me > I cant take a photo of my own setup right now but take this as text)

                    <br><br>

                    the folder of your content should look something like this
                    <br><br>
                    <code>
                        Home folder <br>
                        - Tv show 1 <br>
                        -- Season 1 <br>

                        -- Season 2 <br>
                    </code>
                    <p class="important">
                        PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SEASONS MUST BE CALLED <br><br>
                        "Season X" (x is the number of the Season) <br><br>
