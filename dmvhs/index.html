            <h1>V 0.2.1 (beta)</h1>
            <h2>Increasing the general website quality</h2>
            <div>
                I've been such a bum bro I went to bed at 10pm yesterday. anyways im just making moves to make the website look and work better. 
                <h3>Added</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Different color scheme</li>

                </ul>
                <br>
                You may notice that many elements are now <strong>Statically Sized</strong> instead of being sized reactively
                <br>
                <h3>Removed</h3>
                <ul>

                </ul> 
                <h3>Fixed</h3>

                    <li>Registration button moving the entire tournament information panel</li>
                    <li>Report game button not accurately showing the state of the reported game</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Making moves to retire the old stage picking website</h2>
            <div>
                Ok so this is a quick update before the day I test this out in a production environment for the first time. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Stage Picker To Report Game Page</li>
                </ul>
                this should fix a minor nitpick I've had for a while where I couldnt see what stages people picked.
                Any user can look at what stages a set had to play now.
