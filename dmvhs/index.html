                I swear i didnt lie there is an update coming its just I've been working on starting to use coolify rather 
                than just using the dev server for vite and that involved me setting up a CI/CD pipeline which is taking a while
                devops is not my specialty. aside from that start.gg authentication coming soon

                but there will be updates.

            <h2>Making moves to retire the old stage picking website</h2>
            <div>
                Ok so this is a quick update before the day I test this out in a production environment for the first time. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Stage Picker To Report Game Page</li>
                </ul>
                this should fix a minor nitpick I've had for a while where I couldnt see what stages people picked.
                Any user can look at what stages a set had to play now.
