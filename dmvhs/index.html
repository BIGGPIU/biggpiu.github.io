            <h2>Making moves to retire the old stage picking website</h2>
            <div>
                Ok so this is a quick update before the day I test this out in a production environment for the first time. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Stage Picker To Report Game Page</li>
                </ul>
                this should fix a minor nitpick I've had for a while where I couldnt see what stages people picked.
                Any user can look at what stages a set had to play now.

            <div>
                This website which was created by Diya Shakoor was created to serve as a convienient way for DMV high school students to register for tournaments and do things like check their ELO.

                <ul>

                    <li>Tournament registration</li>
                    <li>Thats basically it</li>
                </ul>
