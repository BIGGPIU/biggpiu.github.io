            <div class="content">In 1990 German Producer Marc Trauner was producing a song on a cheap mixer. Due to the mixer's quality the song would regularly get distorted. Typically after hearing the distortion he would just go back to make adjustments to fix it. Though upon hearing what was produced from the cheap mixers error Marc realized that it actually sounds good. This realization led to him creating the first Electronic Hardcore song: We Have Arrived. This song was received extremely well at the clubs and raves it was played at. This event led to the genre being greatly popularized. <br> At this point in time the BPMs of songs released would be between 140 and 160 BPM</div>
