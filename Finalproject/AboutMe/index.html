                Hello! I don‚Äôt think I have to give too much of an explanation on who I am since I'm kinda in your class. Though I do think it‚Äôs worth giving a bit of an explanation on why I chose this topic and what my history with it is. <br> <br>

                I was first introduced to the hardcore genre in 2019. I found out because this rhythm game I was playing called sound space had featured a great amount of songs from the genre. At the start I didn‚Äôt listen to a very diverse set of music, The main songs I had listened to were things like Speedcore 300, Dangerous Slot, and Tool Assisted Speedcore. Though I did enjoy hearing the songs while I played the rhythm game I did not seek to listen to it outside of the game. <br><br> That changed in 2020 when I had decided to look up Speedcore on youtube because I had liked the genre so much on Sound Space. Looking this up on youtube led to me listening to random compilations and the like on Youtube. Though I did step out of my comfort zone a bit I still didn‚Äôt experiment much outside of the few artists I had listened to. In 2021 things kind of changed since I had decided to make a spotify account that exposed me to more Hardcore music that was outside of what I would normally listen to. Since I started using Spotify that means I got information like my spotify wrapped. In 2021 my favorite artists were M1DY,Imil,Kobaryo,T+Pazolite and QUERLESS. <br><br> In 2022 I had gotten to listen to more unique takes on the genre when I had started going to the arcade to play rhythm games. Heres a recent video of me playing

                I had started playing the HIT DANCE GAME PUMP IT UP XX 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION. I LOVED IT. The game had exposed me to even more hardcore! Songs like ESCAPE by D_AAN had completely hooked me when I played the game. If only I were good enough at the time to actually play the charts escape had though‚Ä¶ Playing pump it up at the arcade had made me want to explore more of the arcade rhythm games there are out there. That led me to Sound Voltex Exceed Gear. That game has so much hardcore it‚Äôs beautiful. That game had introduced me to artists like Roughsketch. Since I still used Spotify in 2022 My favorite artists from 2022 were Kobaryo, Roughsketch ,T+Pazolite, M1DY, IMIL and DJ Myosuke. <br><br> Fast forward to 2023 and I was a full on hardcore fan. I had listened to significantly more hardcore than any other genre that year. Sophomore year didn‚Äôt exactly treat me the best so it was always really reassuring to be able to settle down and listen to my favorite artists. My favorite artists that year were Vaenus, IMIL, M1DY and Kobaryo. <br><br> Now we‚Äôre at the near past. In 2024 I had decided to start a google doc where I rate hardcore albums. Just that had led to me listening to 22 new albums that year which may seem kinda low but it was way more than the amount I had listened to in the past. 2024 was also the year where I had to do this project and do the research surrounding it. It was kind of magical to learn that a song that I had liked listening to was actually a remix of a song from the 90s. It was cool to learn more about the DJs and the culture that surrounded hardcore before I had started listening to it as well. Looking at recordings from some of these concerts makes me want to go to one of them someday. My favorite artists last year were Xystran, IMIL, M1dlet, DJ Myosuke, M1DY, Kobaryo and noisetripper.
                <br><br>Even though it's just a music genre, in the past I had felt some embarrassment for listening to it because of how different it was from the kind of stuff you would hear on the radio. I used to kind of keep it a secret from nearly everyone around me that I was a fan of the genre until 2022. Now it‚Äôs really different. I don‚Äôt feel embarrassed to just like the things that I like and I now enjoy sharing my infatuation with this genre with my friends. Though I still don‚Äôt play my favorite Hardcore albums in the car because some of them are too loud üôÅ. You could say I'm kind of‚Ä¶ a HardcoreHead.
