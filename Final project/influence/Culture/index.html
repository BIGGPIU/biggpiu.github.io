                The popularity of Gabber created a culture in the netherlands. Gabber ravers typically wore Tracksuits, bomber jackets and Nike Air max shoes. Men would typically shave their heads bald while women braided their hair and shaved the sides. As the Gabber subculture grew older it had gained some unwanted following from Neo-Nazis in Germany. To assure these people that Gabber would never welcome them, artists started releasing songs that would feature anti-facist and anti-racist statements. Some people took this to the next level. Mokum Records made its slogan (which was printed on every record they produce) “Hardcore United against fascism and racism” The Gabber community was founded on accepting everyone and they were willing to show it. <br>
                In the mid 1990s Gabber had become a mainstream culture in the Netherlands. There were Gabber parody tracks released at this time. Though Gabber fans were not happy with this due to the commercialization of the Gabber scene. The Gabber Piet: The maker of the parody song “Hakke & Zage” was fired from his job from ID&T due to the song. After this Gabber Piet tried to make an album to make amends with the Gabber community but it didn’t sell well
